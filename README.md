# Mega Man Space 2

## Introduction
Mega Man Space 2 is a Mega Man based fangame with a drastic
change on the genre, tanking the blue bomber into an arcade
space action adventure. Please, feel free to check 
[Mega Man Space], the prequel, as Mega Man Space 2 gets finished.

### Disclaimer
Mega Man is a franchise, character and trademark owned by CAPCOM.
The porpose of this project is self learning as well as entertaining
anyone who plays it. To support Mega Man, CAPCOM and everyone involved
on it, please buy the official games or merchandising. Thank you.

## State of the game
As of today the game is in development on a non playable state. You can
download the code and make a build, but fun is not garanteed. Sugestions,
feedback, issue and any kind of idea in general is well received.

Check this repo or my sites below to stay tuned about the latest updates.
If you can't wait any longer (which I doubt) I suggest you to check the
prequel, [Mega Man Space].

## Tools
The game is being developed using [Godot], an open source game engine.  

Sprites are elaborated with inspiration on the original Mega Man 2 game
(which, by the way, is a very great game). The tool that I use for making
sprites is [Aseprite].  

Music and sound efects will be directly taken from the original Mega Man 2,
with no new themes being planned for the project.

## Changes over Mega Man Space
Mega Man Space 2 is very different to Mega Man Space. Appart from the
new assets and game engine ([Godot] replacing [Game Maker Studio]), there
is a key change in gameplay. In Mega Man Space there were only one enemy
at a time, and it rarely moved away from the top of the screen. In Mega 
Man Space 2 the enemies will come from everywhere, so you need to react
fast to their position, aim at the with the mouse, and fire!  

Other new features are planned such as more upgrades, different modes and
adjustable difficulty.

## The lore
The evil Dr. Wily is making evil plans... Yet again. This time, he sent his
robots into space. Dr. Light has renewed the Megaship so Mega Man can
stop Dr. Wily again and save the day.

### FAQ
Q: Is that Mega Man shooting with his arms or is it a ship where Mega Man is in?  
A: This was a very popular question for [Mega Man Space], when the Megaship design
was very similar to Mega Man extending his arms. I hope this is clear now that
I redesigned the ship with that it mind. In concluison, it's Mega Man inside
a ship.  
  
Q: Do you like spaghetti?
