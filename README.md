## Introduction
Mega Man Space 2 is a Mega Man based fangame with a drastic
change on the genre, tanking the blue bomber into an arcade-like
space action adventure. Please, feel free to check 
[Mega Man Space], the prequel, as Mega Man Space 2 gets finished.

Later versions will be posted on those sites.

## State of the game
As of today the game is in developmente on a playable state, but not all
the content is implemented. Sugestions, feedback and any kind of idea in 
general is well received. Please, feel free to open an issue if you have
anything useful for the game.

Check this repo or my sites below to stay tuned about the latest updates.
If you can't wait any longer to play the game (which I doubt) I suggest
you to check the prequel, [Mega Man Space].

## Tools
The game is being developed using [Godot], an open source game engine.  

Sprites are elaborated with inspiration on the original Mega Man 2 game
(which, by the way, is a very great game). The tool that I use for making
sprites is [Aseprite].  

Music and sound efects will be directly taken from the original Mega Man 2,
with no new themes being planned for the project... But who knows??

## Changes over Mega Man Space
Mega Man Space 2 is very different to Mega Man Space. Appart from the
new assets and game engine ([Godot] replacing [Game Maker Studio]), there
is a key change in gameplay. In Mega Man Space there was only one enemy
at a time, and it rarely moved away from the top of the screen. In Mega 
Man Space 2 the enemies will come from everywhere, so you need to react
fast to their position, aim at them, and fire!  

Other new features are planned such as more upgrades, different modes and
adjustable difficulty.

## The lore
The evil Dr. Wily is making evil plans... Yet again. This time, he sent his
robots into space. Dr. Light has renewed the Megaship so Mega Man can
stop Dr. Wily and save the day one more time.

### FAQ
Q: When will the game be released?  
A: There isn't a specific release date. A release build will be published whenever
I feel the game is ready. I estimate that will be this year. A demo with one level
may be available soon.

Q: Is that Mega Man shooting with his arms or is it a ship where Mega Man is in?  
A: This was a very popular question for [Mega Man Space], when the Megaship design
was very similar to Mega Man extending his arms from the top. I hope this is clear 
now that I redesigned the ship with that it mind. In concluison, it's Mega Man inside
a ship.  
  
Q: Do you like spaghetti?  
A: Yes.
